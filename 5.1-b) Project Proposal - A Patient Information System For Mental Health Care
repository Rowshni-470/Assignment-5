The system will maintain information about patients who are suffering from mental health problem and the information of treatment that they received. The system can be also included in local medical practices or community centers. The system architecture for the software is client- server based system and a centralized database of patient information. The database can be accessible by several local systems though secured network connectivity. The system can be used by several users such as doctor, nurse, medical staff and examiners etc. 

II.	OBJECTIVE

•	To build a user-friendly and adaptable system that can be implemented to assist in medical service to help mentally challenged patients.
